# /write-job-description

Create a professional job description that attracts diverse talent.

## What I Need

Tell me:
- What role are you hiring for?
- What level (junior, mid, senior, lead)?
- What team/department?
- Key responsibilities (top 3-5)
- Must-have vs nice-to-have skills
- Salary range (if sharing)
- Remote/hybrid/on-site?

## What I'll Create

A complete job description with:

1. **Compelling intro** - Why this role matters
2. **Clear responsibilities** - Action-oriented, outcome-focused
3. **Realistic requirements** - Separated into must-have and nice-to-have
4. **Inclusive language** - Checked for bias
5. **Benefits highlights** - What you offer
6. **Company snapshot** - Brief culture description

## Output Format

```markdown
# [Role Title]

## About the Role
[Impact-focused summary]

## What You'll Do
- [Responsibility 1]
- [Responsibility 2]
...

## What You'll Bring
**Required:**
- [Must-have 1]
...

**Nice to Have:**
- [Preferred 1]
...

## What We Offer
[Compensation and benefits]

## About Us

```

## Inclusivity Checks

I'll automatically check for:
- Gendered language
- Unnecessary requirements
- Age-coded phrases
- Jargon that excludes

## Example

```
You: /write-job-description

Role: Senior Product Manager
Team: Growth
Remote: Hybrid (3 days office)

Claude: [Generates complete, inclusive JD]
