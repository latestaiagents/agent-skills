# /performance-review

Write effective performance reviews that drive growth.

## What I Need

Tell me:
- Employee name and role
- Review period
- Key accomplishments (3-5)
- Areas of strength
- Areas for development
- Overall performance level
- Goals for next period

## What I'll Create

A complete performance review with:

1. **Executive summary** - Overall performance snapshot
2. **Accomplishments** - Specific achievements with impact
3. **Strengths** - What they do well with examples
4. **Development areas** - Constructive feedback with suggestions
5. **Goals** - SMART goals for next period
6. **Rating** - According to your scale

## Feedback Quality

I use the SBI model for all feedback:
- **Situation** - When/where it happened
- **Behavior** - What they specifically did
- **Impact** - The result of their action

## Example

```

Strengths: Technical depth, collaboration

Claude: [Generates complete review with specific, actionable feedback]

## Avoid

I'll help you avoid:
- Vague feedback ("good job")
- Recency bias (focusing only on recent events)
- Halo/horn effects
- Discriminatory language
