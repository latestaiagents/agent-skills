## When to Use

- Calibrating performance across teams
- Developing improvement plans

## Review Structure

### Standard Performance Review

```markdown
# Performance Review: [Employee Name]
**Review Period:** [Start Date] - [End Date]
**Reviewer:** [Manager Name]
**Date:** [Review Date]

## Overall Performance Summary
[2-3 sentences summarizing overall performance and impact]

## Key Accomplishments
1. [Specific achievement with measurable impact]
2. [Another achievement with context]
3. [Third achievement]

## Areas of Strength
- [Strength 1 with specific example]
- [Strength 2 with specific example]

## Areas for Development
- [Development area 1 with specific example and suggestion]
- [Development area 2 with specific example and suggestion]

## Goals for Next Period

2. [SMART goal 2]
3. [SMART goal 3]

## Overall Rating
[Rating according to company scale]
```

## Writing Effective Feedback

### The SBI Model (Situation-Behavior-Impact)

```markdown
**Situation:** During the Q3 product launch...
**Behavior:** You proactively identified a critical dependency issue and coordinated with three teams to resolve it before it impacted the timeline.
**Impact:** This saved an estimated two weeks of delay and demonstrated strong cross-functional leadership.
```

### Examples of Good vs Poor Feedback

**Vague (Poor):**
> "Sarah is a great team player and always positive."

**Specific (Good):**
> "Sarah consistently supports her teammates. When the backend team was behind on the API integration, she volunteered to help debug issues despite her own full workload. This collaboration helped the team deliver on time."

**Vague (Poor):**
> "John needs to improve his communication."

**Specific (Good):**
> "John would benefit from providing more context in written updates. In the Q2 project update, stakeholders had questions that could have been preemptively addressed. I recommend using a structured format that includes status, blockers, and next steps."

## Rating Scale Guidelines

### 5-Point Scale Example

| Rating | Label | Description | Distribution |
|--------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| 5 | Exceptional | Consistently exceeds all expectations, role model | ~5-10% |
| 4 | Exceeds | Regularly exceeds expectations in key areas | ~20-25% |
| 3 | Meets | Fully meets expectations, solid performer | ~50-60% |
| 2 | Developing | Partially meets expectations, improvement needed | ~10-15% |
| 1 | Does Not Meet | Significantly below expectations | ~5% |

### Calibration Questions

When assigning ratings, ask:
- Would I enthusiastically rehire this person?
- Would I want them on my team for a critical project?
- How would I feel if they left for another company?

## Competency-Based Feedback Templates

### Technical/Functional Skills

```markdown
**Exceeds Expectations:**
"[Name] has become the team's go-to expert on [technology/skill]. They not only deliver high-quality work but also mentor others. Example: They created comprehensive documentation for our deployment process that reduced onboarding time by 50%."

**Meets Expectations:**
"[Name] demonstrates solid [skill] abilities and consistently delivers quality work. They successfully completed [specific project] on time and within scope."

**Needs Development:**
"While [Name] shows foundational knowledge of [skill], there's opportunity for growth in [specific area]. I recommend [specific development action] to build proficiency."
```

### Communication

```markdown
**Exceeds:**
"[Name] excels at tailoring communication to the audience. Their executive summary of the Q3 results was praised by leadership for its clarity. They also effectively facilitated difficult cross-team discussions."

**Meets:**
"[Name] communicates clearly in meetings and written updates. Stakeholders receive timely information about project status."

**Needs Development:**
"[Name] would benefit from more proactive communication, especially when priorities shift. I recommend sending weekly status updates and flagging blockers earlier."
```

### Leadership/Influence

```markdown
**Exceeds:**
"[Name] leads by example and inspires others. When the team faced a challenging deadline, they rallied the group and maintained morale. Two team members have cited [Name] as instrumental in their growth."

**Meets:**
"[Name] effectively leads their projects and provides guidance to junior team members when asked."

**Needs Development:**
"[Name] has opportunities to increase their influence beyond their immediate work. I encourage them to share their expertise more broadly through lunch & learns or documentation."
```

## Difficult Conversations

### Delivering Critical Feedback

```markdown
**Framework:**
1. State the observation factually
2. Explain the impact
3. Listen to their perspective
4. Collaboratively problem-solve
5. Agree on specific next steps

**Example:**
"I want to discuss the timeline slippage on Project X. The milestone was missed by two weeks, which impacted the marketing launch. I'd like to understand what happened from your perspective, and then let's figure out how to prevent this going forward."
```

### Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) Template

```markdown
# Performance Improvement Plan

**Employee:** [Name]
**Manager:** [Name]
**Start Date:** [Date]
**End Date:** [Date - typically 30/60/90 days]

## Current Performance Gap
[Specific, documented issues with examples]

## Expected Performance Standards
[Clear, measurable expectations]

## Support Provided
- [Resource 1: training, mentorship, etc.]
- [Resource 2]

## Milestones & Check-ins
| Date | Milestone | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Week 2 | [Specific milestone] | |
| Week 4 | [Specific milestone] | |
| Week 8 | [Specific milestone] | |

## Consequences
[Clear statement of what happens if improvement is not achieved]

**Signatures:**
Employee: _______________ Date: ___
Manager: _______________ Date: ___
HR: _______________ Date: ___
```

## Self-Review Prompts

Provide these to employees before reviews:

```markdown
1. What are you most proud of accomplishing this period?
2. What challenges did you face, and how did you handle them?
3. What skills have you developed or improved?
4. Where do you want to grow in the next period?
5. What support do you need from your manager?
6. What feedback do you have for your manager or team?
```

## Best Practices

1. **No surprises** - Feedback should be given throughout the year, not just at review time
2. **Be specific** - Use examples, dates, and measurable outcomes
3. **Balance** - Include both strengths and development areas
4. **Future-focused** - Connect feedback to growth opportunities
5. **Document** - Keep notes throughout the review period
6. **Two-way dialogue** - Reviews should be a conversation, not a monologue
